## Study Questions
1.) Information Systems hardware means: The physical portions of an IT system.
2.) The shift toward mobility in computing has been caused by the shrinking size, increasing power, and reduced power consumption of circuits per moores law.
3.) Moore's law has impacted hardware 2 fold: the doubling of transistors roughly every two years leads to an increase in speed & performance of newer hardware. It also leads to processors built on "older" architectures to come down in price making the hardware replacement cycle fairly predictable.

4.) The IoT is a system of computer devices/ machines that are all networked and can transfer data without any human interaction. The IoT works by taking data/information provided by a devices sensors, "talking" to the cloud or another device to pass that information on, letting software process what the best course of action is to do with that data/information, and reflecting what was done with that data to an end user via a GUI or another UI/UX. There are a vast array of IoT devices available today, the most common categories are smart home devices: (Alexa speakers, Google home, Nest/ Digital life and other integrated security/home automation systems, Lifx lightbulbs, Phillips hue, & smart outlets), specialized sensors: (networed temperature sensors in a kiln, water level sensors in a water treatment plant, sugar feed sensors in a food procesing plant) Healthcare and fitness devices (fitbit's, whoop bands, apple watches), networked camera's, and smart cars. Smart home devices like the amazon echo dot are awesome because they provide multiple convienient features in a simple to manage interface allowing you to control other devices around the house, search for information,
