## Study Questions
1.) Information Systems hardware means: The physical portions of an IT system.
2.) The shift toward mobility in computing has been caused by the shrinking size, increasing power, and reduced power consumption of circuits per moores law.
3.) Moore's law has impacted hardware 2 fold: the doubling of transistors roughly every two years leads to an increase in speed & performance of newer hardware. It also leads to processors built on "older" architectures to come down in price making the hardware replacement cycle fairly predictable.

4.) The IoT is a system of computer devices/ machines that are all networked and can transfer data without any human interaction. The IoT works by taking data/information provided by a devices sensors, "talking" to the cloud or another device to pass that information on, letting software process what the best course of action is to do with that data/information, and reflecting what was done with that data to an end user via a GUI or another UI/UX. There are a vast array of IoT devices available today, the most common categories are smart home devices: (Alexa speakers, Google home, Nest/ Digital life and other integrated security/home automation systems, Lifx lightbulbs, Phillips hue, & smart outlets), specialized sensors: (networed temperature sensors in a kiln, water level sensors in a water treatment plant, sugar feed sensors in a food procesing plant) Healthcare and fitness devices (fitbit's, whoop bands, apple watches), networked camera's, and smart cars. Smart speakers like the amazon echo dot are awesome because they provide multiple convienient features in a simple to manage interface allowing you to control other smart devices around the house, search for information, make calls, and take control of almost any function via the usage of complimentary hardware like the raspberry pi/ arduino, software like tasker and automate and platforms like IFTTT. In addition to all of the utilitarian features ofered, the dot echo can play games and music, make measurement converions and many more things via adding skills.

5.) The personal computer is considered a commodity now because there are very few differentiators between various models, the price is main factor that determines sales.
6.) The CPU can also be thought of as the brain of the computer.
7.) The units of measure for data storage in order from smallest to largest are Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte, Zettabyte,& Yottabyte.
8.) The motherboard is the bus of the computer
9.) Two differences between RAM and storage are: 1) RAM is volatile storage (it only retains data while powered) where as storage (HDD or SSD)is non volatile (it does not require power to retain data) 2) RAM is faster than storage due to it being random access while storage is sequential access.
10.) SSD's have numerous advantages over HDDs. Some of the biggest are: 1) No moving parts provide less failure points, 2) read and write speeds are faster since you dont have to wait for platters/heads to move,  3) SSD's are lighter and can be smaller or placed into more form factors than HDD's due to having less internal components.

## Excercises 

1) The desktop I am currently building to replace my previous development/ gaming rig has the following components: CPU- Core i7 12700K (Alder Lake $449.99), Mobo- Asus ROG Strix Z690-F ($399.99),  Hard disk- Samsung 980 Pro (1 TB, boot $184.99), Segate FireCuda (5TB $154.99) ,RAM- Corsair Dominator Platinum (DDR4 32GB $294.99), computer case- Cooler Master C700p (449.99), Cooling- Corsair iCue H150i ($159.99), Power- ASUS ROG Strix 1000W ($242.00), GPU- Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 ($699.99), Disk drive- LG CA40N ($69.89). I am sure all these components work together because the motherboard says it is designed for LGA 1700 sockets (which is what all alder lake processors are) thus including support for PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 both of which are standarized meaning modern compnents will have no problem being connected. As my SSD is NVMe (PCIe 3.0) & my hybrid drive and disk drive are all USB 3.2 everything fits and is compatible.  This build has been quite epensive coming in at a retail of $3106.81 with my real world cost closer to $2100 thanks to ebay and the current GPU shortage. This build manages to be $323.18 less than a compareable alienware build (Ryzen 9 5900, RTX 3080, 32GB DDR4, 1TB SSD) while allowing me the procesor I prefer and providing 5 TB more memory.
2) 
## Latency and Transfer rate
Both latency and transfer rate affect the overall performance of a hard drive and its system. As mechanical latency is a direct function of platter rotational speed, it is measuring how long it takes the drive's head to find a data sector and make it available from the initial system request for that data/sector. Transfer rate can be broken into a few categories: Disk tranfer rate measures the speed that data is transferred between the head and the platters and host tranfer rate measures the speed that the computer can move data across the interface (EIDE/ SCSI) to the CPU. As both of these functions affect how quickly the drive can index and acesss data, they both have an impact on a HDD/ and system performance.

## Solid State vs Hard Drives
Solid state drives are different from traditional HDD's in multiple ways. 1) Solid state drives use NAND or SDRAM storage in lieu of platters and a head. This reduces the number of moving parts and makes them less prone to failure as well as providing faster read and write times. 2) SSD's have a lower power draw due to quicker data access and a lack of moving parts. 3) Ssd's are more expensive on average and offer smaller storage sizes than traditional HDD's due to the cost of flash memory and limitations associated with flash memory.

### Random Access Memory
Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster because more of a programs data/instructions can be loaded into the RAM requiring less usage of the swap file on the HDD which is slower to access. The difference between 32 and 64 bit data paths are the number of bits transferred in one clock cycle. 32 bit data paths can transfer 32 bits of data per clock cycle while 64 bit data paths can transfer 64 bits per clock cycle.
