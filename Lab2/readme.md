## Study Questions
1.) Information Systems hardware means: The physical portions of an IT system.
2.) The shift toward mobility in computing has been caused by the shrinking size, increasing power, and reduced power consumption of circuits per moores law.
3.) Moore's law has impacted hardware 2 fold: the doubling of transistors roughly every two years leads to an increase in speed & performance of newer hardware. It also leads to processors built on "older" architectures to come down in price making the hardware replacement cycle fairly predictable.
4.)
